# What is CAD?

Simply put, CAD is short for Computer Aided Design. Using software and virtual simulations to design, build, and test parts, we can create any idea we have.

## How does this appy to VEX?

We can use CAD to design, build, and stress-test parts and robots as a whole. This helps us better predict what to do in the real world, when physically building robots, and allows the designer to account for tolerances and custom parts ahead of time.

CAD leads to more complex, more advanced and clean robots overall.

## The Discord

There is also a [VEX CAD Discord](https://discord.gg/BKV3DJm)! The Discord is a hub of people an designers, dedicated to CAD and design.&#x20;
