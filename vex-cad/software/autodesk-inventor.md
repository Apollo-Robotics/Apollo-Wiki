## Parts

The VEX CAD Community has compiled a [library of parts](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor) that can be readily used with Inventor.

It is recommended to structure everything inside 1 folder to keep your CAD's organized as some versions of the library are not cross-compatible and file issues can occure when saving within Inventor.
