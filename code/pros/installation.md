# Installation

PROS Can be installed in a few ways. The currently supported and most fully-featured method of installing and using PROS is through the VSCode Platform:

1. Install [VSCode ](https://code.visualstudio.com/)for your respective platform. You will have to install it locally either on a supported Windows, Mac, or Linux Machine. ChromeOS is not supported natively at the moment. Also, VSCode's online IDE, [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), will not work.
2. Once VSCode is installed, you will need to install some extensions, including the PROS extension. You can install extensions through the 'Extensions Tab' located in the lefthand menus.

*   Here are the Extensions you will need to install:

    * [PROS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sigbots.pros)
      * The compiler and overall debugger for PROS. This also will download the nessecary files for copliling PROS projects locally, such as the kernel and CLI

    You can get away with just the PROS Extension, but here are some others that improve the quality of life for coding that I personally recommend:

    * [clangD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
      * Helpful for code errors, debugging and autocompletion.
    * [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
      * Adds some useful tools including CMake and C/C++ Tools.


* You can either click on these links to navigate to the web browser and install them, which will open them up in VSCode and allow you to install them, or type them into the search bar of the Extensions tab.

That's it! That's all it takes to install PROS onto your computer.
