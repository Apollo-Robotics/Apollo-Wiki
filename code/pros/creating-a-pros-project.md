# Creating a PROS Project

Once you've installed PROS and the requisite VSCode extensions, you'll need to create a project to start coding. Here's how to do so:

1. In a VSCode window, navigate to the PROS side menu. Under `Conductor` , click `Create project` to create a new project.

</div>

2. VSCode will prompt you for a location in which to create a new project. The project will be located in a new folder within this directory. Usually, to keep code organized, most people create a folder within their `Documents` folder for their PROS code projects.
3. Than, VSCode will prompt you for a project name, with the default being `my-project`.

4. Than, VSCode will prompt you for the platform you intend to run the program on. Unless you are using VEX Cortex, select the `v5` option.

5. Than, VSCode will prompt you for the version of the Kernel you want to run. Typically it is best to choose the default, latest, version of the kernel. The latest version is 4.0.6 but the most stable version is 3.8.0. Choose that

6. PROS will than do its thing in the background, and if all goes well, your VSCode window should refersh with the created PROS Project folder open!
