# Welcome!

## Welcome to the Apollo Library for PROS

The Apollo Library is a template of custom functions and classes written for the Purdue Robotics Operating System ([PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/)). The Library is modeled after other similar libraries, such as [EZ-Template](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/), [Okapi Lib](https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/index.html) and [LemLib](https://lemlib.github.io/LemLib/).&#x20;

The library is a ready-to-use installation, contaning functions for driver control, autonomous control, built-in graphing templates, algorithms, controllers, and other awesome functionalities.
